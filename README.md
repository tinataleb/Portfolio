## PROJECTS
### FOCUS
Focus helps users practice mindfulness by providing a breathing rhythm through haptic cues while engaging their cognitive foreground with the simple task of sorting balls by color. FOCUS examines the power of VR to improve introspect and to eliminate effects of external sensory stimuli. FOCUS is suited to elevate concentration traits of people who are distracted by an overload of information in the modern world.

### Attis
Attis is an IOT device that enables collaboration between users and uses Google cloud vision API to detect ingredient and generates recipes based on them. Attis uses Google’s text-to-speech APIs to guide the user throughout the cooking experience by explaining the steps and using the integrated timer.

### An Enquiry Regarding Robot Understanding
Husky challenges user to think about how robots understand the surroundings by 
guideing them through husky’s congnition step: sensing, interacting, interpreting, and expressing. It engages users in an interactive, provocative, and open-ended inquiry concerning the robot’s intelligence. Husky, originally a lawn mower, uses ROS to navigate and transfer, openCV, Google APIs, and neuro network to sense and interpret its sorroundings, and it interacts with others in person through facial expression and its one of a kind language while posting on robot social media to stay conneccted to its robot friends. It uses two raspbery pi’s, a camera, speaker, and a screen.

### MatchEZ
Commonly used dating apps fail to accommodate for users with visual impairment due to their vision-centric design. MatchEZ is an android app that pairs with most popular dating apps such as bumble to provide an enabling interface for such users by integrating voice messaging, proper color schemes, and generating and reading descriptive text from images by using google cloud APIs.

### CS370: Web App for Tutoring Services
Designed and developed a web application for UC Berkeley's CS370 class using Ruby on Rails. I worked in a team of 6 developers and our process included meetings with the client, use of software development practices and tools, and testing and maintaining the website. My role involved generating mock ups, designing UI, and development.
